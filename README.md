# hello-world
I'm new to coding and I'm here to learn. I have two jobs and a family and I'm working to make us a better life.
I have a lawn business and I work at Costco. My hobbies or passions are powerlifting and writing. I have published two children's books on Amazon. I am a bit of an artist and illustrating my books was a blast. My wife and children are my utmost priorities.
